if you want to contribute...well talk to me...also if you want to use.

in any case, if you want to check out how this works, then using node-gyp to compile is all good an well AFTER you've done this:
1. clone this one
2. create a deps folder under the root folder of where you cloned the project to
3. clone pdf-writer project into there (more precisely i need all the component libraries - libjpeg, libtiff, freetype, zlib, pdfwriter)
4. now you can got "node-gyp configure" and then "node-gyp build"

5. to test, check out the tests folder
